# Retrieval

## Resource Collection Query
Oftentimes its necessary to search for a resource within a given collection. In order **to execute queries in a collection, query parameters MUST be used**. Such query parameters SHOULD be named following the template {attribute}({filterVerb}), e.g: `/states/?name=california`, `/states/?nameStartsWith=cali`.

**Query parameters for resource collection queries MUST be in camel case form**. This indeed differs with the hyphenated form of the resource path. The reason behind it are the common industry practices and avoidance of the need of characters that need special encoding. **Query parameters for another purposes SHOULD be in camel case form**.

## Resource Collection Ordering
**The results of a resource collection MAY be ordered using some of its attributes**. **The order MUST be specified in an `orderBy` query parameter**.

**The `orderBy` query parameter MUST accept at least one order expressions (in a comma separated list) used to sort the collection items**. If multiple expressions are present they MUST be applied left to right. For instance, the following get states ordered first by `name` and then by `population`:

`/states?orderBy=name,population`

**The order expressions MAY contain suffix `asc` for ascending or `desc` for descending**, separated from the property name by a coHippococolon. **On absence of `asc` or `desc` the ascending order MUST be used**. For instance, the following get states ordered descending by name:

`/states?orderBy=name:desc`

**The order is alphanumerical and any NULL values MUST sort as *less than* non-NULL values**.

**To escape a colon, two contiguous colons MUST be used.**
