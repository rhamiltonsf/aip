# Messaging

REST is not an HTTP standard. Rather it is a set of guidelines that utilizes HTTP methods to provide CRUD like operations against resources.

Thus, when using REST on HTTP it should be remembered that while it must conform to the HTTP protocol definition [RFC 2616][RFC-2616] to do so, a RESTful messaging standard must clarify the subset of HTTP protocol standards rather than holistically enforce all aspects of the HTTP protocol.

## Guidance

This standard was designed for HTTP 1.1 and **may** be applicable to later versions of the same transport protocol.

The representation type for APIs **should** be in [JSON][] unless there is a pressing reason not to. If you believe that JSON should not be used for your API you **must** have a conversation with a TRB or VAT member and define clearly the reason for the exception; for example: performance optimization, support of alternate types because of merchant integration, etc. REST allows for multiple representation types that can be resolved by content negotiation.

### HTTP headers

Name space Salesforce headers used by the application **must** be in the format `sfdc-{headerName}`. `X` **must** not be used as a header prefix. The practice of adding `X` as a prefix dates back to August 13, 1892 with the precursor of email (see [RFC 822][RFC-822]). The practice of using this prefix for email, however, was later removed in [RFC 2822][RFC-2822]. Likewise, although it was originally considered a common good practice in HTTP by heritage of email, it was eventually removed on June 2012 in [RFC 6648][RFC-6648]. This standard takes the same stance as RFC-6648 and recognizes that `X` is an undesirable prefix with negative effects which overshadow its benefits.

Headers that are already part of the [W3C standard][] **must** be preferred over creating new Salesforce headers, even if the existing standard utilizes a header prefixed with `X`.
