# Field Names

There is sufficient discussions in the web around the preferred route to defining the casing for JSON attributes. The two popular approaches are Snake Case and Camel Case. 

```
{"line_item": "I am Snake Case"}
{"lineItem" : "I am Camel Case"}
```

While this is very opinionated, the recommendation is to use Camel Case with the following detailing the same:

* **Camel Case Property Names**
* Property Names must be descriptive
* First Character of the property must be** a letter**,** an underscore or a dollar sign**. Samples are shown below:

```
{
  "lineItem": "I am a Camel Cased Line item",
  "_orderNumber": "I am an underscore prefixed order number",
  "$money": "I am a $ prefixed money"
}
```

**JSON Singular Vs Plural Property Name**
For **Array Types **the property name should be **plural**, for all other property names, it should be **singular**.

```
{
  "orderNumber" : "102312313", // Singular
  "lineItems" : [ // Plural
     {"itemId" : "2123",
      "quantity" : 200
     },
     ...
  ]
}
```
