# Style Guide - Resource Types and Traits

There are many advantages of reusing patterns across multiple resources and methods. For example, the characteristics of a collection-type resource can be defined and then applied to multiple resources. This use of patterns encourages consistency and reduces complexity for servers and clients. [â€ ](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#resource-types-and-traits)  
  
Traits **must** be UpperCamelCase, e.g: `NotFoundException`, to maintain coherence with the rest of the API documentation
