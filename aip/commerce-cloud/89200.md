# Style Guide - RAML Document Root

_The root section of the RAML document describes the basic information about an API, such as its title and version. The root section also defines assets used elsewhere in the RAML document, such as types and traits._ [â€ ](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#the-root-of-the-document)  
  
Projects **must** leverage the `uses` node to import libraries. Individual types, traits, etc. **should not** be included (this is using `!include`). One example for `uses` could be:

```uses:
    ApiStandards: /exchange_modules/893f605e-10e2-423a-bdb4-f952f56eb6d8/api-standards/1.1.0/api-standards.raml
    CommerceCloudStandards: /exchange_modules/893f605e-10e2-423a-bdb4-f952f56eb6d8/commerce-cloud-standards/1.0.0/commerce-cloud-standards.raml
```

The `title` **should** be Upper Space Case. For example: `Shopper Baskets`.  
  
The `protocols` **must** be set to HTTPS only. Due to the obvious security implications.  
  
The `version` **must** be set and follow the pattern `/v[0-9]+/`. Same as with the [URL Pattern standards](https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/display/ENG/API+Standards#APIStandards-URLPattern).  
  
The `description`:

*   **must** be set.This is the corner stone of a well documented API.
*   **must not** include the word `TODO`. Nothing last forever, except `TODO` lines, those last forever and ever.
