# Resource names

The Commerce Cloud standards for resource names follow [AIP-2100][], with the following additional requirements for their definitions in RAML.

## Collection identifiers

Collection Identifiers **must not** start with symbols. Starting with non-symbols is important to keep [magic symbols][] and special meanings out of the URL.

[AIP-2100]: ../2100.md
[magic symbols]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)
