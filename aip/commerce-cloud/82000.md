# Resource

The Commerce Cloud Standards for resources follow [AIP-2000][], with the following additional requirements for their definitions in RAML.

## Guidance

A resource is identified by its relative URI, which **must** begin with a slash (`/`) in the RAML definition.

[AIP-2000]: ./2000.md
[RAML resources]: https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#resources-and-nested-resources
