# Style Guide - Introduction
API specs play a fundamental role in the experience that API merchants developers will have. A perfectly functional API might have an unpleasant experience because its specification is made without choices, e.g: some types start with upper camel case and others don't or because the design choices are disparate from the rest of the APIs even if the other APIs are also specified using RAML.

API specs should be created using consistent styles to enable a better experience along with other benefits as: improved ability to automatically validate APIs, improved ability to generate software development kits, better ability to automatically discover functionalities of the API and other.

This documents specify a RAML style guide. The style guide is built on top of the experience gained in the [Mercury APIs: Definition of Done](/81000) document.


## Terminology

### General terms

* Common standards libraries
 * Two RAML libraries are provided by the CC API C4E: **[API Standards](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/893f605e-10e2-423a-bdb4-f952f56eb6d8/api-standards/minor/1.1/)** providing API fragments that could potentially be reused all across Salesforce and **[Commerce Cloud API Standards](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/893f605e-10e2-423a-bdb4-f952f56eb6d8/commerce-cloud-standards/minor/1.0/)** with the fragments useful only within Commerce Cloud.

### Conventions
The key words "**must**", "**must not**", "**required**", "**shall**", "**shall not**", "**should**", "**should not**", "**recommended**", "**may**", and "**optional**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Text Case Examples

* **kebab-case**

  In allusion to the appearance of a kebab, with various food items assembled on a skewer. Kebab case combines words by replacing each space with a dash (-), as follows:

  `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` → `lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet`


  Acronyms are expressed as if they were a regular world:

  `My ID is 123` → `my-id-is-123`


* **lowerCamelCase**

  Refers to the appearance of the humps of a camel. It concatenates the components without spaces and capitalizes the first letter of each word, starting with the _second_ word (therefore, it starts with a *lower*case letter).

  `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` → `loremIpsumDolorSitAmet`


  Acronyms are expressed as if they were a regular world:

  `My ID is 123` → `myIdIs123`


* **UpperCamelCase**

  Refers to the appearance of the humps of a camel. It concatenates the components without spaces and capitalizes the first letter of each word, starting with the _first_ word (therefore, it starts with an *upper*case letter). 

  `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` → `LoremIpsumDolorSitAmet`

  Acronyms are expressed as if they were a regular world:

  `My ID is 123` → `MyIdIs123`


* **Upper Space Case**

  Also known as Title Case. It concatenates the components with spaces and capitalizes the first letter of each word, starting with the _first_ word.

  `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` → `Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet`


  Acronyms are expressed in *all-caps*:

  `My ID is 123` → `My ID Is 123`


* **snake_case**

  In allusion to the appearance of a snake slithering across the ground. Note that snake_case is not currently acceptable anywhere in our standard, but is included for completeness in the definitions. Snake case combines words by replacing each space with a dash (_), as follows:

  `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` → `lorem_ipsum_dolor_sit_amet`

  Acronyms are expressed as if they were a regular world:

  `My ID is 123` → `my_id_is_123`
