# Style Guide - Modularization

RAML provides several mechanisms to help modularize the ecosystem of an API specification: Includes, Libraries, Overlays, Extensions.[â€ ](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#modularization)  
  
The usage of`!include` for modularization within an API is **not recommended**. It often confuses the parser as it cannot semantically identify the reused portion as one thing and will show the same documentation over and over even if effectively the included portion is just one thing, for example the following is not recommended:

```
#%RAML 1.0
title: Example API
version: v1
resourceTypes: !include patterns/resourceTypes.raml
traits: !include patterns/traits.raml
```

To share API fragments within an API, libraries **should** be used. When leveraging these libraries `uses` must be leveraged, `include` **should not** be used, e.g:

```
#%RAML 1.0 Library
# This file is located at libraries/file-type.raml
types:
  File:
    properties:
      name:
      length:
        type: integer
#%RAML 1.0 Library
# This file is located at libraries/files.raml
usage: |
  Use to define some basic file-related constructs.
uses:
  file-type: file-type.raml
```
To share API fragments across different APIs, [libraries](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#libraries) **must** be used. When leveraging these libraries the `uses` statement must be applied, the `!include` statement **should not** be used. See example above.
