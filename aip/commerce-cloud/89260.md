# Style Guide - Security Schemes

Most REST APIs have one or more mechanisms to secure data access, identify requests, and determine access level and data visibility. [â€ ](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#security-schemes)  
  
Security schemes **must** be reused when possible. APIs are not special when compared security wise and therefore **must not** maintain specific secure definitions in their API. APIs representing access management are an obvious exception to this rule and **may not** use the security schemes defined in the Standards libraries.  
  
Custom `SecuritySchemes` **should** provide a meaningful `displayName`. Otherwise the underlying platform, _Exchange_, will have all of them are listed on based of the same `x-custom` type.
