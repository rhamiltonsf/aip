# Style Guide - Annotations

Annotations provide a mechanism to extend the API specification with metadata beyond the metadata already defined in this RAML 1.0 specification.[â€ ](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#annotations)  
  
All annotations **must** be pre-approved by the corresponding _API C4E_. Annotations will be visible by the final user oftentimes leaking internal information and also they just clutter up and add confusion.
