# Requests

Sometimes in an API there are cross cutting concerns that affect all requests in the API. These cross cutting concerns need to be considered for each request when communicating to the server.

## Guidance

TLS **must** be used everywhere. Encrypted is preferred over non-encrypted communication for obvious security reasons. TLS does add additional cost to the transport but the cost is not significant compared to the benefits. MaxCDN found a 5ms latency when testing encrypted vs un-encrypted connections with an increase 2% CPU. With HTTP/2 we can expect this to only be faster due to fewer network trips for data exchange. You should also note that while it might not be beneficial for API's the use of TLS has [SEO benefits][] over non-SEO resources.

Certificate management solutions will need to be provided on GCP and AWS for E-W traffic.

### HTTP headers

Parameters that affect the _behavior_ or an API **must not** be passed via an HTTP header. Exceptions are granted for headers that are already part of the [W3C standard][].
