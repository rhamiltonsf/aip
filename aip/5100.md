# Requests

Service uptime and reliability is very important and it is possible that certain unexpected overload traffic patterns can affect the quality of service and in dire cases lead to service outages as well due to overload.  Adding capacity and enabling elastic growth helps but does nothing for prioritization and usage governance.  Rate limiting although can be handled within each service, the recommendation is that it is best handled via a network appliance higher in the network call stack as it is a cross cutting concern that has applicability to the entire service ecosystem.

APIs SHOULD apply rate limit. Rate limited services MUST return the following headers for rate-limited endpoints:

* `X-Ratelimit-Remaining`: The amount of available quota.
* `X-Ratelimit-Limit`: The maximum available requests per window.
* `X-Ratelimit-Reset`: The remaining time, in milliseconds, until a new window starts.
