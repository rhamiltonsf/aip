# Pagination

APIs often need to provide collections of data, most commonly in the [List][] standard method. However, collections can often be arbitrarily sized, and also often grow over time, increasing lookup time as well as the size of the responses being sent over the wire. Therefore, it is important that collections be paginated.

## Guidance

When retrieving data from a collection of resources, you **must** use `offset` and `limit` pagination controls. The `offset` control indicates the point from which to start the retrieval of data, and `limit` describes the number of data points to return, if available.

```
/weblogs?offset=4&limit=100
```
An API **must** return the limit if there are enough items, otherwise it **must** return the remaining items in the collection. All APIs **must** document their default value for **limit**.

The response **must** provide enough information for subsequent and/or previous requests to be retrieved. The following list of response headers is related to pagination:

* `SFDC-Pagination-Offset`, offset requested, **must** be returned.
* `SFDC-Pagination-Limit`, limit requested, **must** be returned.
* `SFDC-Pagination-Total-Count`, results returned count, **may** be returned.
* `SFDC-Pagination-Result-Count`, total results, **may** be returned.
