# Pagination

When retrieving data from collection resources you should always use pagination controls.  Prefer to standardize on **offset** and **limit**. Offset indicates the offset from which to start the retrieval of data and limit describes the number of data~~ ~~points to returns if available. Example:

```
/weblogs?offset=4&limit=100
```

In the event the limit is not provided, consider defaulting to a reasonable size an ensure you document it as part of the API.

The Response to the request must provide enough information for subsequent and/or previous requests to be retrieved. The following is a list of response headers related with pagination:


* `SFDC-Pagination-Offset`, offset requested, MUST be returned.
* `SFDC-Pagination-Limit`, limit requested, MUST be returned.
* `SFDC-Pagination-Total-Count`, results returned count, MAY be returned.
* `SFDC-Pagination-Result-Count`, total results, MAY be returned.
