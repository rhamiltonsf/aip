# Resource Names

**When working with collection resources** like `orders` where you will retrieve many, **the resource collection name MUST be plural**, i.e., `*/orders*`. Access to individual orders would naturally follow with `*/orders/{id}*`. While there is nothing semantically wrong with `*/order/{id}*`, we are choosing an opinionated format around collection resources using plurals. 

One exception to the plural rule is `*/status*`. that SHOULD be used as is given its nature of singleton.

The resource name **`actions` is reserved and MUST not be used** except as described in [Resource Actions](https://salesforce.quip.com/Ft7PApbFhE3g#ZWGACAEczSy).

**Resources collections MUST appear left to right in a containment relationship**. For instance `/states/california/counties/sonoma` is correct as a state contains counties, the opposite: ~~`/counties/sonoma/states/california`~~ would be wrong.

**When collections are empty, endpoints MUST return an empty collection** (as opposed to a 404 or null).
