# Long-running operations

HTTP has a synchronous request-response model where HTTP requests timeout if there is a period of inactivity. There are operations that could take hours or days and keeping a HTTP request alive without timing out after such period of inactivity might not work.

The Async Pattern is used to handle such scenarios for handling long running tasks.

## Guidance

Let's say we have a service that does job precessing from RESTful Web Services. For example:

```
POST /jobs HTTP/1.1
Host: [jobs.cc.salesforce.com](http://jobs.cc.salesforce.com/) 

Give me the prime factorization of this 10,00000 digit number
....
```

The server would accept this `POST` request, create a new job, and schedule it to run. This job could take a long time, so the server response back to the client with a response stating that the job has been created and that the client can check it periodically for completion.

Responses from the such asynchronous requests **should** use the `202` (Accepted) HTTP response status:

```
202 Accepted
Location: https://jobs.cc.salesforce.com/jobs/job-1234
```

Once the job has been completed, the client can fetch the data from the resource. If the client makes a request while the job is still processing then it will respond with an HTTP status of `202`. The client can choose to `DELETE` the job during or after completion be deleting the job resource.
