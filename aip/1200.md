# Change Management

When deprecating an API use the **[Warning](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.5)** header to indicate to clients the deprecation. Use the Warning Code of `299`, and a message of the form *The path /operation/parameter is deprecated and will be removed by {date}. Please see link for details*.  The link should provide details on the deprecation and removal. While the warning is good for deprecation and due-diligence, it can easily be ignored by the clients . For this reason, monitor the usage of the deprecation by clients to know who is using the deprecated API.
