# Resource Types

REST is specially well suited for CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations. Nonetheless, sometimes it might be deemed necessary to go beyond these operations to reach a some degree of RPCfulness.

In such scenario, **the word `actions` MUST be used after a resource to contain RPC operations**. However, before rushing into creating actions it's important to remember that **REST methods MUST be preferred to resource actions when possible**.

In order to illustrate this with an example we can consider a thing that is *pausable*. Something like a **pause** action could be modeled as: ~~`/pausableThing/actions**/pause**`~~. At a first glance this might look right, however it's quite the opposite. This is perfectly achievable with the standard set of REST methods and resources as `pausableThing` could have a status body element that could be `PUT` or `PATCH` with the pause state representation. 

The previous example is meant to demonstrate how easy is to fall in the trap of unnecessary action verbs. An extended effort and discipline MUST be always applied in order to guarantee the preference of REST methods over resource actions.
