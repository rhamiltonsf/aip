# Standard methods: Get

In REST a resource resides at an address and can be retrieved. These resources can be retrieved by calling the standard `GET` method on a resource address.

## Guidance

APIs **should** provide a `GET` method for resources unless there is a reason users don't need this. The purpose of the `GET` method is to return data from a resource.

### Request message

Resources are retrieved using the HTTP `GET` method against the resource address. To get a single resource, the address **must** end with a resource ID.

```
GET /books/{bookId}
```

For more information about queries against a resource collection, see [AIP 132][AIP-132].

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with a `403` (Permission Denied) response. Permission **should** be checked prior to checking if the resource exists.

If the user does have proper permission to access the resource, but the resource does not exist, the service **must** error with a `404` (Not Found) response.
