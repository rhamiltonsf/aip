# Backwards compatibility

APIs are fundamentally contracts with clients which deploy production services to be used by customers. The expectation of a client is that the API contract will be honored by the server and not break their production services. Therefore, it is important to understand what constitutes a backwards compatible change and what constitutes a backwards incompatible change.

## Guidance

When a backwards incompatible change cannot be avoided, a new API endpoint **must** be created and the old endpoint **must** be deprecated.

A deprecated API **must** use the [`Warning` header] and use the warning code of `299` in the response. The response **must** contain a message of the form:

```
"The path /operation/parameter is deprecated and will be removed by {date}. Please see link for details"
```

The link **should** provide details on the deprecation and removal.

While the warning is good for deprecation and due-diligence, it can easily be ignored by the clients. For this reason, monitor the usage of the deprecation by clients to know who is using the deprecated API.
