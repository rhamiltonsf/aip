# Responses

## Minified Response

While a pretty JSON response is more readable, it includes unnecessary white space which adds to the response size. For this reason responses MAY be minified. 

```
{"customer":{"id":"101010","firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Doe"}} // Prefer

{ "customer": { // Not Preferred
   "id": "101010",
   "firstName": "Jane",
   "lastName" : "Doe"
  }
}
```
