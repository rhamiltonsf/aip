# Resource Caching

## TODO
This needs images pulled from the original Quip document

ECom could subsequently cache the **yeezy** product returned by the Product Service.  During the cache validation period, ECom does not need to request the product data from the origin server. However, once the cache has timed out a request is issued by the Client with the following headers:

```
GET /products/yeezy
If-Modified-Since: Date-1
If-None-Match: "abc"
```

If the resource for the product is unchanged on the service, the service responds back with a **304** status code (Not Modified)  and no content in the body. If the resource has changed, the origin server responds back with a **200** (OK) and new Last-Modified  Date and new ETag along with the updated Product information.
