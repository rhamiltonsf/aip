# Versioning

Versioning is the practice of assigning a unique number to a released API to describe the compatibility of that release with other releases of the same API. It can be used to warn API consumers of breaking changes between two API releases.

API versioning is not a panacea for badly or improperly thought through APIs to hide behind. However, through well designed APIs and well planned deprecation strategies, API versioning allows for API Designers to innovate upon their APIs maintaining positive relationships with their consumers.

## Guidance

When making changes to your API that require a new version, first consider the migration and maintenance costs for service maintainers and service consumers. You **should** introduce changes to your API in a **non-breaking** manner that allows service consumers that need the change to adopt the new version without breaking the API for those that do not need the change.

However, some necessary changes to your API will eventually break backward compatibility. In such cases, consider the guidance and resources in [AIP 180][].
