# Versioning

API Versioning is not a panacea for badly or improperly thought through API's to hide behind. There is migration and maintenance cost associated with versioning from a service maintainer and service consumers perspective. For this reason prefer to introduce changes in a **non-breaking** manner that will allow service consumers that need the change to adopt the same while not breaking those that do not need it.

The above said, the eventuality faced by many services for varying reasons is to break backward compatibility. In such cases, consider the following document for guidance on Backward compatibility of API. [Microservices and Versioning](https://salesforce.quip.com/DG4cA3wa1bp9)
