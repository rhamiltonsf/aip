# Resources

A resource represents any core entity of an API that is important enough to be referenced as its own thing. Because all functionality of an API flows from its resources, you **must** standardize on resource naming and behavior.

## Guidance

All resources **must** be addressable via a URI. Without a URI, you can't perform any actions on a resource.

Resource URIs **must** follow the standards outlined in [RFC 3986][RFC-3986]. Additionally, resource URIs **must** be lowercase. Except for the scheme and host, _URI's are case sensitive_. For example, the following are two separate URIs:

```
https://api.commerce-platform.salesforce.com/inventory-reservations/2020112122 // correct
https://api.commerce-platform.salesforce.com/Inventory-Reservations/2020112122 // incorrect
```

Resources **should** be modeled within a hierarchy, where each node is either a simple resource or a collection of resources. These nodes **must** define a containment relationship from left to right within the URI. For instance `/state/california/counties/sonoma` is correct as states contain counties. The same resources defined in the opposite direction would be wrong: `/counties/sonoma/states/california`.

A resource usually has fields, and resources may have a number of sub-resources.

[Resource id segments]: ./122.md#resource-id-segments
