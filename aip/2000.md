# Resource

Resources are quintessential to REST, from the very core of its purpose to the every single one of its capabilities. It is due to this relevance that special effort is put into resource standardization. In the book RESTful Web Services resources were described as:


> A **resource** is anything that's important enough to be referenced as a thing in itself


However, to be a resource is also a condition of necessity to be addressable. **All resources MUST be addressed by an URI**. Again, as put in Richardson's and Ruby, RESTful Web Services:


> URI's are what make a resource what it is. A 'thing' is only considered to be a resource if it has at least one URI addressing it. 


**URI Paths MUST be lowercase**. Keep in mind that *URI's are case sensitive* (RFC 3986 (http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-3986.txt)) except of the scheme and host part. For example the following two are separate URIs:

`https://api.commerce-platform.salesforce.com/*inventory-reservations*/2020112122 // DO`
`[~~https://api.commerce-platform.salesforce.com/~~](https://api.commerce-platform.salesforce.com/)~~*Inventory-Reservations*/2020112122~~ // DO NOT`

**For word separation of resources, hyphens (-) SHOULD be used**. Underscore, space and other characters SHOULD be avoided for this purpose, e.g:

```
http://api.**commerce-platform**.salesforce.com/inventory-management/**location-groups**/{locationId}/skus/{skuId} //More readable
~~http://api.**commerce_platform**.salesforce.com/inventory-management/**locationGroups**~~~~/{locationId}/skus/{skuId}~~  //Less readable
```

Things are addressed in the real world by using nouns, e.g: *teapot*, *mouse*, *bridge*. Therefore, it is natural to leverage the same approach in REST. It is also noteworthy to mention that verbs do not address things under any circumstance, e.g: ~~*start-teapot*~~, ~~*move-mouse*~~, ~~*cross-bridge*~~. With the exception of the `actions` described bellow, **o****nly nouns MUST**** be used for resource naming** (see Google's reasoning [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/restful-api-design-nouns-are-good-verbs-are-bad)), verbs do not represent a noun except for extremely rare occasions where subjectivation is applied, e.g: search, when a search is understood as a thing that can be created, destroyed, etc; rather than a verb.

The following is a list of valid resource addresses:

```
**/****orders** - Orders in the system
**/customers/{customerId}/****orders** - Orders of a customer
**/customers/{customerId}/****addresses** - known addresses of a customer
```

The following listing shows invalid resource addresses as they fail to only use nouns:

```
~~/**create-user**
/~~**~~edit-user~~** 
```

There are cases when to endpoints point to the same order. One possible example is the following listing that shows two endpoints which points to the same resource.

```
/customers/jdoe/orders/23121 
/customers/jdoe/last-order 
```

However, **it is RECOMMENDED that every resource has the smallest number of endpoints pointing directly to the representation of the resource as possible**. In the previous example it would mean that only the first line is pointing to the representation of the resource while `last-order` would return a `307 Temporary Redirect` (although other cases could  leverage `301 Moved Permanently` or others).
